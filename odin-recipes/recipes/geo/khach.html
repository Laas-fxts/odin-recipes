	<h1>Khachapuri (Georgian Cheese Bread)</h1>
		<p>With a cheese-stuffed crust and an egg baked into the center, this boat-shaped Georgian bread is so fun and versatile, there's only a matter of time before it's delivered to every home for pizza night and ordered from every brunch menu the morning after. They take a little finesse but the payoff is well worth it; after all, what more could you want other than cheesy, soft-while-chewy bread dipped in its own bed of runny egg yolk and molten cheese?</p>

					<li>2 1/2 cups all-puprose flour, divided</li>
					<li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded</li>
					<li>4 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
					<li>8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>For the Rest</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>2 large eggs</li>
					<li>1 tablespoon butter, cut into 4 pats</li>
					<li>sea salt to taste</li>
					<li>1 pinch cayenne peere or to taste (Optional)</li>
				</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2> 
		<!-- I do not know how to realise this better but according to knowledge what I have I just put <p> -->
			<ol>
				<p><li>Combine milk, water, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Add olive oil, 2 cups flour, and salt. Mix until a sticky dough comes together.</li></p>
				
				<p><li>Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead for about 3 minutes, adding in remaining flour as needed, until dough is very soft but still workable. Form into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li></p>
				
				<p><li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Combine Monterey Jack, mozzarella, and feta cheeses in a bowl. Toss together and refrigerate until needed.</li></p>
				
				<p><li>Punch down dough and turn out onto a floured surface. Flatten slightly and cut in half. Dust a large sheet of parchment paper with flour. Place 1 dough half on top and roll out into a square about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick, stretching out the corners as needed. Arrange 1/4 of the cheese in 2 rows, 1 to 2 inches from the longest sides. Roll sides up tightly over the cheese, forming a canoe shape around the dough. Pinch and twist ends to seal.</li></p>
				
				<p><li>Cut off excess parchment around the dough; lift dough onto a baking sheet. Repeat shaping and stuffing the other dough half. Fill the canoe with the remaining cheese mixture.</li></p>
				
				<p><li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Form a well in the center of each khachapuri using a spoon; crack an egg inside each well.</li></p>
				
				<p><li>Return to oven and bake until eggs are mostly set, 3 to 4 minutes. Place 2 pats of butter over each filling and sprinkle salt and cayenne on top. Plate khachapuri; tear off one end and use it to stir the butter into the egg.</li></p>
			</ol>

		<h2>Chef's notes:</h2>
			<p>You can substitute 3/4 fine salt for the kosher salt.</p>
			<p>Use 1 pound of any cheese blend you like, but feta adds a welcome tangy flavor.</p>
