	<h1>Pancakes with Jam</h1>
		<p>This recipe was given to me by my Russian teacher/neighbor. It is tried and true, and my family loves it! Cooking time really depends on how many skillets you are using! Many years ago when I first started making the blini, I used 1 skillet and it took forever to use up all the batter. Now I use 4 skillets and the time goes by quickly. I have substituted coconut oil and it tastes delicious, but it tends to harden if the batter is cold. Batter can be refrigerated for later use. Serve hot with sour cream and/or jelly.</p>
